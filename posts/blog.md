### Ingredients

**For the sponge**

* 2 tbsp matcha powder
* 2 tbsp cocoa powder
* 200g self-raising flour
* 2 pinches salt
* 170g butter, at room temperature
* 170g caster sugar
* 3 large eggs, beaten
* ½ tsp vanilla extract
* 4 tbsp milk

**For the frosting**

* 150g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
* 150ml double cream
* A little matcha powder, for sprinkling

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease and line a 20cm Springform Cake Tin.
2. Sift the matcha powder and cocoa powder into two separate bowls. Sift 100g flour into each bowl and add a pinch of salt to each one. Stir to mix.
3. Beat the butter and caster sugar together in a large mixing bowl until light and fluffy, using a handheld electric mixer or a wooden spoon. Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well between each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and milk.
4. Transfer half the mixture to a separate bowl and fold in the matcha flour using a large metal spoon. Tip the cocoa flour into the remaining plain mixture and fold in lightly. Spoon both mixtures alternately into the prepared tin, then use a fork or spoon to swirl them together a little in the tin.
5. Bake for 45-50 minutes until risen and firm. Test with a fine skewer inserted into the centre – it should come out clean. Bake for a little longer if necessary. Cool in the tin.
6. For the frosting, put the chocolate pieces into a bowl. Heat the cream until almost boiling, pour it over the chocolate and leave for 3-4 minutes. Stir well and leave to cool, then chill until thickened.
7. Remove the cake from the tin and slice in half horizontally. Use half the frosting to fill the cake, then sandwich the two halves together. Spread the rest on top of the cake and sprinkle with a little matcha powder.

**Tips:** don’t be tempted to swirl the two mixtures together too much, as you’ll lose the lovely marbled effect.
