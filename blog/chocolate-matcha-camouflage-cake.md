A **chiffon cake** is a type of sponge cake made with eggs, sugar, flour, and oil. It uses meringue (whipped egg whites) as a leavening agent for its light and airy texture. What separates chiffon cake from an angel cake is its unique ingredient: vegetable oil. Oil, unlike butter or shortening, remains liquid at room temperature, helping the cake stay moist.
